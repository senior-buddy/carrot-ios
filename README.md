Carrot is an easy-to-use, real-time framework for building applications with multi-device AR capabilities. It works using WebSockets, Golang on the server-side, and a unique location tracking system based on iBeacons that we aptly named The Picnic Protocol. Using Carrot, multi-device AR apps can be created with high accuracy location tracking to provide rich and lifelike experiences. To see for yourself, check out Scribbles, a multiplayer drawing application made with Carrot. You can see a demo video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EVtb0pJPgk) and the code [here](https://github.com/carrot-ar/scribbles-ios).
